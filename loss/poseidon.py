import torch 

"""
Here we define a loss function 'loss_poseidon' that computes the P3P transformation to estimate the camera pose and the distance from the camera to the 3D points.
The 3D points are known and are handily labeled in the world coordinates.
The 2D points are obtained by the YOLO-NAS-POSE model, which is trained to detect the 2D points in the image coordinates.
The loss function will compute the P3P transformation and return the loss value, estimated camera pose, and distances from the camera to the 3D points.

This function is designed to be used in a PyTorch environment and expects the input tensors to be on the same device (CPU or GPU).

The loss tends to be zero when the camera pose is estimated correctly and the 2D points are projected correctly from the 3D points.
And the loss tends to be large when the camera pose is estimated incorrectly.
